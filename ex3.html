        <h1>Your Reality by Dan Salvato</h1>
        <b>Verse 1</b>
        <p>Every day, I imagine a future where I can be with you<br>
        In my hand is a pen that will write a poem of me and you<br>
        The ink flows down into a dark puddle<br>
        Just move your hand, write the way into his heart<br>
        But in this world of infinite choices<br>
        What will it take just to find that special day?<br>
        What will it take just to find that special day?</p>
    </div>
    <p><span>[Instrumental]<br><br><b>Verse 2</b></span>
    <br>
    Have I found everybody a fun assignment to do today?<br>
    When you're here, everything that we do is fun for them anyway<br>
    When I can't even read my own feelings<br>
    What good are words when a smile says it all?<br>
    And if this world won't write me an ending<br>
    What will it take just for me to have it all?<br>
    </p>

    <p><b>Verse 3</b><br>
    Does my pen only write bitter words for those who are dear to me?<br>
    Is it love if I take you, or is it love if I set you free?<br>
    The ink flows down into a dark puddle<br>
    How can I write love into reality?<br>
    If I can't hear the sound of your heartbeat<br>
    What do you call love in your reality?<br>
    And in your reality, if I don't know how to love you<br>
    I'll leave you be<br>
    </p>
